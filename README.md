The RecipeBook application is an offline storage app for viewing, adding, and scheduling recipes and meals.  The user can enter recipes manually, search for recipes already entered, and schedule upcoming meals using a calendar interface.  Recipes are automatically saved to each user's computer when the application is closed, and automatically loaded into the app from the user's locally saved file when the app is opened.

Users can also use the program to select a random recipe should you, like me, be an indecisive cook. That page is shown below:
